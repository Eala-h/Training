.. Control Systems and Introduction to the EPICS Toolkit
.. -----------------------------------------------------
.. **Accelerator Control System:** connects the Operator in the control room with the accelerator hardware. The control room might not be near the accelerator.

.. *For example:* SESAME has N Computers, N magnets, N vacuum pumps, 5 beamlines, a cooling system, RF system, power supply system, ... etc. which all need to be closely and heavily controlled.

.. .. image:: images/EPICS_slide4.png

.. **Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS)**: is a collaboration software tool kit, that provides a control system architecture suitable for research and industrial facilities such as accelerators. EPICS uses a Client/Server and Publish/Subscribe methods and a Channel Access network protocol (3-tier architecture or 3 layer model). 

.. .. image:: images/EPICS_slide10.png

.. EPICS is an *open-sourced* project assembeled by multiple collaborators in the accelerator industry, 12+ accelerators around the world have provided assistance in its development and still use it to this day. 


.. **Channel Access:** A protocol to transfer data over network, a single data unit is called a **Process Variable**. The entire set of Process Variables establish a Distributed Real-time Database of machine statis, information and control parameters.

.. .. image:: images/EPICS_slide11.png

.. **Channel Access Network Flow:**

.. 1) Query: broadcast and connection request.
.. 2) Answer: direct connection
.. 3) All further queries and answers work directly (Point-To-Point)

.. .. image:: images/EPICS_slide12.png

.. **Main Access Commands in EPICS:**

.. - ``caget``: returns the value of the PV or any sub-fields in the PV. 
.. - ``caput``: sets a value of a PV or a sub-field in a PV to a desired value and displays the old and newly assigned values.
.. - ``camonitor``: sets up a monitor and continuously prints incoming changing values for PVs.
.. - ``cainfo``: Prints all available channel status and information for a PV.

Packages that required for EPICS installation 
.............................................


- **gcc**: GCC stands for GNU Compiler Collection. It is a collection of programming language compilers and tools, primarily used for compiling and linking C, C++, and Fortran programs. GCC supports multiple platforms and is widely used in the development of software applications.

- **gcc-C++**:This package is an extension of GCC and specifically includes the C++ compiler. It is required if you want to compile and build C++ programs using GCC. The package provides the necessary libraries and headers for C++ development.

.. code-block:: bash

        # To install the GCC compiler, run the following commands:
        sudo dnf clean all
        sudo dnf update
        sudo dnf group list
        sudo dnf group install "Development Tools"



- **make** : Make is a utility used for building and managing software projects. It is used to automate the process of building executable programs and libraries from source code. The "make" utility uses a "Makefile" to define the build process. It is a text file that contains instructions for the "make" utility to execute. The "make" utility is often used in conjunction with the GCC compiler to build software projects. The "make" utility is included in the "Development Tools" package group. If you have already installed the "Development Tools" package group, you do not need to install the "make" utility separately.

.. code-block:: bash

        # To install the make the following command:
        sudo yum install make

- **gcc-toolset-9-make**: This package is a part of the GCC Toolset, which is a collection of development tools and libraries. It includes the "make" utility, which is used to manage and build software projects. The version number "9" in the package name refers to the specific version of the GCC Toolset. It is likely that this package includes GCC version 9 and the associated "make" utility.


.. code-block:: bash

        # To install the gcc-toolset-9-make from source the following command: 
        wget https://dl.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/8/Devel/x86_64/os/Packages/g/gcc-toolset-9-make-devel-4.2.1-2.el8.x86_64.rpm

        # To install the gcc-toolset-9-make from source the following command:
        sudo yum install gcc-toolset-9-make-devel-4.2.1-2.el8.x86_64.rpm




- **readline-devel**: The readline library is used for line editing during command-line input. It provides features like command history, editing capabilities, and tab completion. The "readline-devel" package contains the development files and headers needed to compile programs that use the readline library. If you are building a program that requires readline functionality, you would need this package.

.. code-block:: bash

        # To install the GCC compiler, run the following command:
        sudo yum install readline-devel 

- **perl-ExtUtils-Install**: Perl is a popular scripting language used for various purposes, including system administration and web development. The "perl-ExtUtils-Install" package is a Perl module used for installing Perl extensions and modules. It provides tools and utilities to simplify the installation process of Perl packages.



.. code-block:: bash

  # To install the perl-ExtUtils-Install package, run the following command:
    sudo yum install perl-ExtUtils-Install



EPICS Installation on Rocky Linux
---------------------------------

To install EPICS on Rocky Linux, follow these steps:

.. code-block:: bash

  # To install epics from source the following command: 
  wget https://epics-controls.org/download/base/base-3.15.6.tar.gz
  # Then extract the file
    tar -xvf base-3.15.6.tar.gz
    # Then go to the extracted directory
    cd base-3.15.6
    # Then run the following command
    make
    # Then run the following command
    make install


Then you have to add the following to the .bashrc file 
which where you can store your environment variables.

.. code-block:: bash

  # To open the .bashrc file
    vim ~/.bashrc
    # Then add the following lines to the file
    export EPICS_BASE=${HOME}/base-3.15.6
    export EPICS_HOST_ARCH=$(${EPICS_BASE}/startup/EpicsHostArch)
    export PATH=${EPICS_BASE}/bin/${EPICS_HOST_ARCH}:${PATH}



Then to check if the installation is successful, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash 

    # Then add the following lines to the file
    caget -h
    # Then you should see the following output
    No pv name specified. ('caget -h' for help.)


.. code-block:: bash

  # Run the following command to check if the installation is successful 
    caget
    # Then you should see the following output
    No pv name specified. ('caget -h' for help.) 

if so then the installation is successful.

EPICS IOC Creation
------------------

.. code-block:: bash

        # To create a new IOC
        mkdir testIOC
        cd testIOC
        makeBaseApp.pl -t ioc iocName
        makeBaseApp.pl -i ioc iocName
        vim configure/RELEASE
        # Make sure EPICS base path and support modules are written in the right form
        vim testIOC/testApp/Db/test.db
        # Go to the Makefile in the Db directory
        # Make sure that the area where there is "xxx.db" is filled in with the name of the db file you have created previously. "test.db" in this case.

Add the following lines to the test.db file

.. include:: Text-material/recored.txt

.. code-block:: bash

    # Now to Build the IOC do the following
    cd
    cd testIOC
    make
    make install
    # After it has been built, to check whether if the build was successful, go to testIOC/db/test.db (this is an uneditable file, if it has the same content as the one you have created in the testApp/Db then the build was successful)

    # Finally to activate the IOC, run the following command, (pay attention to switch the names of this IOC to the specific one you have created)
    ./bin/linux-x86_64/iocName iocBoot/iocName/st.cmd





Only the following lines should be in the Makefile file.

.. include:: Text-material/recored.txt


.. code-block:: bash

    cd
    cd testIOC
    vim Makefile


IOC Database
............

In the IOC database, there are units of PV's called **Records**. Each of these records have a specific type that allows them to alter the functionality of the PV. In every one of these records, there are **fields**, in which include attributes and some of the possible functions that that the PV could do. 

**Record:** an object with a unique name, properties (**fields**) and contains information (data) where different data types can appear in different fields. A record also has the ability to perform actions on data.

**Naming a PV:** a PV is comprised of two parts
- The record name
- The name of a field belonging to that record

For example: ``ARIDI-PCT:CURRENT.`` in this case most record fields can be accessed individually.

Note: if no field name is given, Channel Access will default to using the .VAL field. 

A general structure of what you might see in an IOC in terms of records and fields is the following:

.. code-block:: bash

  record(ai, "test:Altitude_PV") {
    field(INP, "@user")
    field(VAL, 0.0)
  }


  record(ai, "test:Base_PV") {
    field(INP, "@user")
    field(VAL, 0.0)
  }


  record(calc, "test:Calc_PV") {
    field(DESC, "Calculation of side C (hypotenuse)")
    field(CALC, "SQR(A*A + B*B)")
    field(INPA, "test:Altitude_PV CP")
    field(INPB, "test:Base_PVÂ CP")
  }

As mentioned previously, altering these records could be done using the

The documentation for the list of records on EPICS and their respective fields can be found on this page: https://epics.anl.gov/EpicsDocumentation/AppDevManuals/RecordRef/Recordref-3.html

After curating your IOC database, in order to interact with it one would have to use a Channel Access (CA) Client. 

Some of the most used CA clients are the following: 

- Command line tools(caget,caput,...)
  
  .. image:: images/EPICS_slide21.png

- ALH: Alarm Handler
  
  .. image:: images/EPICS_slide25.png
    
  .. image:: images/EPICS_slide24.png

- StripTool: Strip-chart Plotting Tool

Small Exercise for bash scripting
---------------------------------


Introduction
............

This script is a Bash script that interacts with EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System) and logs the output to a file. The script contains functions to retrieve and set values for EPICS records and logs the operations to the "output.log" file.

Functions
.........

1. ``log()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   The ``log()`` function appends a log message with the current date and time to the "output.log" file.

   Parameters:
   - ``$1``: The message to be logged.

   Usage:
   .. code-block:: bash

      log "Message to be logged"

2. ``get_record_value()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   The ``get_record_value()`` function retrieves the value of a specified EPICS record and logs it using the ``log()`` function.

   Parameters:
   - ``$1``: The name of the EPICS record to retrieve the value for.

   Usage:
   .. code-block:: bash

      get_record_value "record_name"

3. ``set_record_value()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   The ``set_record_value()`` function sets a specified value for a given EPICS record and logs the operation using the ``log()`` function.

   Parameters:
   - ``$1``: The name of the EPICS record to set the value for.
   - ``$2``: The value to be set for the EPICS record.

   Usage:
   .. code-block:: bash

      set_record_value "record_name" "value"

Usage Example
.............

Below is an example of how to use this script:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Setting the value of test:AO1 record to 50
   set_record_value "test:AO1" "50"

   # Setting the value of test:SI1 record to "Hello, EPICS!"
   set_record_value "test:SI1" "Hello, EPICS!"

   # Setting the value of test:Base_PV record to 3
   set_record_value "test:Base_PV" "3"

   # Setting the value of test:Altitude_PV record to 4
   set_record_value "test:Altitude_PV" "4"

   # Retrieving and logging the value of test:Calc_PV record
   get_record_value "test:Calc_PV"

Conclusion
..........

This script provides a simple way to interact with EPICS records and log the operations to a file. Please make sure you have the necessary EPICS tools installed and configured before running the script.

Note: Replace "record_name" and "value" in the usage examples with the appropriate EPICS record name and value you want to use in your application.




IOC Hypotenuse Project Exercise
...............................
After knowing the Database section this is a small Exercise that would help you to put your knowledge into practice. 



- Define a record that calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle. The record should have two input fields, A and B, and one output field, VAL. The record should calculate the hypotenuse using the following formula:
.. math::
    Hypo= \sqrt{A^2 + B^2}


- To test :in your terminal
    * caput <record_name>:A <value>
    * caput <record_name>:B <value>
    * caget <record_name>

.. image:: images/triangle.png 

   
.. code-block:: bash

    record(ai, "test:Altitude_PV") {
      field(INP, "@user")
      field(VAL, 0.0)
    }


    record(ai, "test:Base_PV") {
      field(INP, "@user")
      field(VAL, 0.0)
    }


    record(calc, "test:Calc_PV") {
      field(DESC, "Calculation of side C (hypotenuse)")
      field(CALC, "SQR(A*A + B*B)")
      field(INPA, "test:Altitude_PV CP")
      field(INPB, "test:Base_PVÂ CP")
    }

.. code-block:: bash

  caput test:Altitude_PV 3
  caput test:Base_PV 4
  caget test:Calc_PV

Then you should see the answer in the terminal

PV Triangle Plotter with Python
-------------------------------
A Python script for manipulating Process Variables (PV) and plotting a triangle based on the given base and altitude values.


.. code-block:: python

  import sys
  import argparse
  import matplotlib
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import numpy as np

  from epics import caget, caput, cainfo


  def ca_put_info(pv, value):
      caput(pv, value)


  def ca_get_info(pv):
      return caget(pv)

  def draw_triangle(base, altitude):
      # Define the triangle vertices
      vertices = [(0, 0), (base, 0), (0, altitude), (0, 0)]

      # Extract the x and y coordinates from the vertices
      x = [vertex[0] for vertex in vertices]
      y = [vertex[1] for vertex in vertices]

      # Plot the triangle with filled sides
      plt.figure()
      plt.plot(x[:2], y[:2], '-o', color='red')  
      plt.plot(x[1:3], y[1:3], '-o', color='green') 
      plt.plot(x[2:], y[2:], '-o', color='blue')  

      # Create a cool gradient color map
      cmap = matplotlib.cm.get_cmap('cool')

      # Fill the triangle with a cool gradient color
      plt.fill_between(x[:2], y[:2], color=cmap(0.3), alpha=0.3)
      plt.fill_between(x[1:3], y[1:3], color=cmap(0.5), alpha=0.3)
      plt.fill_between(x[2:], y[2:], color=cmap(0.7), alpha=0.3)

      # Add labels to each side
      plt.text((x[0] + x[1]) / 2, (y[0] + y[1]) / 2, 'base', ha='center', va='bottom', color='red')
      plt.text((x[1] + x[2]) / 2, (y[1] + y[2]) / 2, 'hypo', ha='center', va='bottom', color='green')
      plt.text((x[0] + x[2]) / 2, (y[0] + y[2]) / 2, 'altitdue', ha='right', va='top', color='blue')


      plt.xlabel('X')
      plt.ylabel('Y')
      plt.title('Triangle')
      plt.grid(True)
      plt.savefig('triangle_plot.png')

  def main(args):
      if len(args) != 2:
          print('Only 2 numbers are allowed')
          sys.exit(1)
      else:
          print('Args:', args)
          print(caget('test:Base_PV'))
          ca_put_info('test:Base_PV', args[0])
          ca_put_info('test:Altitude_PV', args[1])
          print(ca_get_info('test:Calc_PV'), 'is the calculated value')

          base = args[0]
          altitude = args[1]
          draw_triangle(base, altitude)


  if __name__ == '__main__':
      parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
          description='Process two numbers for PV manipulation')
      parser.add_argument('number1', type=int, help='Base number')
      parser.add_argument('number2', type=int, help='Altitude number')

      args = parser.parse_args()
      numbers = [args.number1, args.number2]
      main(numbers)








Usage
.....

The script requires two command-line arguments: `number1` and `number2`. These arguments represent the base and altitude values respectively.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python pv_triangle_plotter.py number1 number2

Arguments
.........

.. option:: number1
.. option:: number2

   Base and altitude numbers used to calculate the area and draw a triangle.

   Both arguments should be integers.

Functionality
.............

1. Process Variable Manipulation:

   The script uses the `epics` library to interact with Process Variables (PVs) using the Channel Access (CA) protocol. The following functions are used for PV manipulation:

   - ``ca_put_info(pv, value)``: Writes a value to the specified PV.
   - ``ca_get_info(pv)``: Reads the value from the specified PV.

2. Triangle Plotting:

   The script includes a function named ``draw_triangle(base, altitude)`` that plots a triangle based on the given base and altitude values. The triangle is plotted using matplotlib.

   The function performs the following steps:

   a. Defines the vertices of the triangle based on the given base and altitude.
   b. Extracts the x and y coordinates from the vertices.
   c. Plots the sides of the triangle using different colors.
   d. Fills the triangle with a gradient color.
   e. Adds labels to each side of the triangle.
   f. Sets the axis labels, title, and grid for the plot.
   g. Saves the plot as a PNG file.

   Note: The matplotlib library is required to run this script.

Example
.......

To calculate the area and plot a triangle with a base of 5 and an altitude of 8, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python pv_triangle_plotter.py 5 8

This will write the base and altitude values to the corresponding PVs, calculate the area using a separate PV, and save the triangle plot as `triangle_plot.png`.

PLC and Siemens PLC 
------------------------------


1. PLC: What are they and why are they used?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PLC, or Programmable Logic Controllers, are specialized digital computers used in industrial automation and control systems. They are designed to automate and control electromechanical processes, replacing traditional relay-based control systems. PLCs are widely used in various industries, including manufacturing, automotive, power generation, and more, due to their flexibility, reliability, and ease of programming.

2. Benefits of PLC:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Flexibility: PLCs can be easily reprogrammed to adapt to different processes and tasks without requiring physical changes to the system.
- Reliability: They offer high reliability and robustness, ensuring stable operations in demanding industrial environments.
- Modularity: PLC systems are modular, allowing easy expansion and customization based on the complexity of the control task.
- Remote Monitoring and Control: PLCs enable remote monitoring and control of industrial processes, leading to better efficiency and reduced downtime.
- Real-time Performance: PLCs operate in real-time, ensuring quick responses to inputs and providing precise control over processes.

3. Why we use ladder programming for PLCs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ladder Logic Programming is one of the most commonly used programming languages for PLCs. It resembles electrical relay ladder diagrams, making it intuitive for engineers and electricians to understand and work with. The ladder programming language allows users to create logic-based control algorithms using graphical representations of relay logic circuits. This makes it easier to troubleshoot and modify the PLC programs, as well as reducing the learning curve for new users.

4. Why do we need EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System) for PLCs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EPICS is a set of open-source software tools widely used in the control system and accelerator communities. It provides a robust and flexible framework for integrating different hardware and software components, including PLCs, into a unified control system. EPICS enables data sharing, synchronization, and monitoring between various devices and applications in complex control environments. Integrating EPICS with PLCs allows for seamless communication between PLCs and other parts of the control system, facilitating efficient data exchange and control.

5. Introducing Siemens PLC:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Siemens PLC is a series of programmable logic controllers developed by Siemens AG, a leading multinational engineering and technology company. Siemens PLCs are known for their advanced features, reliability, and widespread use in industrial automation. They come with various models and series to cater to different application requirements, making them suitable for a wide range of industries.

6. Explain S7nodave driver:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

S7nodave is a popular open-source driver used for communication with Siemens S7 PLCs. It allows data exchange between a computer and the Siemens PLC over Ethernet using the ISO-on-TCP communication protocol. S7nodave provides a simple and straightforward interface to read and write data to the PLC's memory, enabling seamless integration of Siemens PLCs with external systems, such as EPICS.

7. How to install S7nodave:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install S7nodave, follow these steps:

1. Download the S7nodave driver from the official website or repository.
2. Extract the downloaded files to a directory on your computer.

8. How to configure S7nodave for communication with Siemens PLC:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure S7nodave for communication with Siemens PLC, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the communication with the PLC::

    s7nodaveConfigureIsoTcpPort("S7PLC", "192.168.0.1", 0, 2, 0)

. Define input and output records in EPICS database (db) files

.. code-block:: bash


      record(ai, "plc:red") {
          field(DTYP, "s7nodave")
          field(INP, "@PLC MD1.1 float")
          field(SCAN, "0.1 second")
      }

      record(ai, "plc:white") {
          field(DTYP, "s7nodave")
          field(INP, "@PLC MD1.2 float")
          field(SCAN, "0.1 second")
      }

      record(ai, "alc:green") {
          field(DTYP, "s7nodave")
          field(INP, "@PLC MD118 int16")
          field(SCAN, "0.1 second")
      }

      record(bi, "plc:button") {
          field(DTYP, "s7nodave")
          field(INP , "@PLC MD121 ")
          field(SCAN, "0.1 second")
          field(ZNAM, "OFF")
          field(ONAM, "ON")
      }

      record(bo, "plc:led") {
          field(DTYP, "s7nodave")
          field(OUT, "@PLC MD2.3 ")
          field(ZNAM, "OFF")
          field(ONAM, "ON")
      }

In the above configuration, we define several EPICS records for different data types (analog input, analog output, binary input, and binary output) that communicate with the Siemens PLC using the S7nodave driver.

- ``DTYP``: Specifies the record's device type, which is set to "s7nodave" to use the S7nodave driver.
- ``INP``: Specifies the PLC memory address from which the record reads data.
- ``OUT``: Specifies the PLC memory address to which the record writes data.
- ``SCAN``: Sets the scan rate for the record, determining how often it reads or writes data from/to the PLC.
- ``ZNAM`` and ``ONAM``: Define the names for the zero (false) and one (true) states for binary records.

By configuring these EPICS records with the appropriate memory addresses and data types, the PLC can be efficiently interfaced and controlled within the EPICS control system.
