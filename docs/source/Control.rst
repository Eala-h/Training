Control Engineering
===================

Control Systems and Introduction to the EPICS Toolkit
-----------------------------------------------------
**Accelerator Control System:** connects the Operator in the control room with the accelerator hardware. The control room might not be near the accelerator.

*For example:* SESAME has N Computers, N magnets, N vacuum pumps, 5 beamlines, a cooling system, RF system, power supply system, ... etc. which all need to be closely and heavily controlled.

**Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS)**: is a collaboration software tool kit, that provides a control system architecture suitable for research and industrial facilities such as accelerators. EPICS uses a Client/Server and Publish/Subscribe methods and a Channel Access network protocol (3-tier architecture or 3 layer model).

EPICS is an *open-sourced* project assembeled by multiple collaborators in the accelerator industry, 12+ accelerators around the world have provided assistance in its development and still use it to this day. 


**Channel Access:** A protocol to transfer data over network, a single data unit is called a **Process Variable**. The entire set of Process Variables establish a Distributed Real-time Database of machine statis, information and control parameters.

**Channel Access Network Flow:**

1) Query: broadcast and connection request.
2) Answer: direct connection
3) All further queries and answers work directly (Point-To-Point)

**Main Access Commands in EPICS:**

- ``caget``: returns the value of the PV or any sub-fields in the PV. 
- ``caput``: sets a value of a PV or a sub-field in a PV to a desired value and displays the old and newly assigned values.
- ``camonitor``: sets up a monitor and continuously prints incoming changing values for PVs.
- ``cainfo``: Prints all available channel status and information for a PV.

Packages that required for EPICS installation 
......................


- **gcc**: GCC stands for GNU Compiler Collection. It is a collection of programming language compilers and tools, primarily used for compiling and linking C, C++, and Fortran programs. GCC supports multiple platforms and is widely used in the development of software applications.

- **gcc-C++**:This package is an extension of GCC and specifically includes the C++ compiler. It is required if you want to compile and build C++ programs using GCC. The package provides the necessary libraries and headers for C++ development.

.. code-block:: bash

        # To install the GCC compiler, run the following commands:
        sudo dnf clean all
        sudo dnf update
        sudo dnf group list
        sudo dnf group install "Development Tools"



- **make** : Make is a utility used for building and managing software projects. It is used to automate the process of building executable programs and libraries from source code. The "make" utility uses a "Makefile" to define the build process. It is a text file that contains instructions for the "make" utility to execute. The "make" utility is often used in conjunction with the GCC compiler to build software projects. The "make" utility is included in the "Development Tools" package group. If you have already installed the "Development Tools" package group, you do not need to install the "make" utility separately.

.. code-block:: bash

        # To install the make the following command:
        sudo yum install make

- **gcc-toolset-9-make**: This package is a part of the GCC Toolset, which is a collection of development tools and libraries. It includes the "make" utility, which is used to manage and build software projects. The version number "9" in the package name refers to the specific version of the GCC Toolset. It is likely that this package includes GCC version 9 and the associated "make" utility.


.. code-block:: bash

        # To install the gcc-toolset-9-make from source the following command: 
        wget https://dl.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/8/Devel/x86_64/os/Packages/g/gcc-toolset-9-make-devel-4.2.1-2.el8.x86_64.rpm

        # To install the gcc-toolset-9-make from source the following command:
        sudo yum install gcc-toolset-9-make-devel-4.2.1-2.el8.x86_64.rpm




- **readline-devel**: The readline library is used for line editing during command-line input. It provides features like command history, editing capabilities, and tab completion. The "readline-devel" package contains the development files and headers needed to compile programs that use the readline library. If you are building a program that requires readline functionality, you would need this package.

.. code-block:: bash

        # To install the GCC compiler, run the following command:
        sudo yum install readline-devel 

- **perl-ExtUtils-Install**: Perl is a popular scripting language used for various purposes, including system administration and web development. The "perl-ExtUtils-Install" package is a Perl module used for installing Perl extensions and modules. It provides tools and utilities to simplify the installation process of Perl packages.



.. code-block:: bash

  # To install the perl-ExtUtils-Install package, run the following command:
    sudo yum install perl-ExtUtils-Install



EPICS Installation on Rocky Linux
---------------------------------

To install EPICS on Rocky Linux, follow these steps:

.. code-block:: bash

  # To install epics from source the following command: 
  wget https://epics-controls.org/download/base/base-3.15.6.tar.gz
  # Then extract the file
    tar -xvf base-3.15.6.tar.gz
    # Then go to the extracted directory
    cd base-3.15.6
    # Then run the following command
    make
    # Then run the following command
    make install


Then you have to add the following to the .bashrc file 
which where you can store your environment variables.

.. code-block:: bash

  # To open the .bashrc file
    vim ~/.bashrc
    # Then add the following lines to the file
    export EPICS_BASE=${HOME}/base-3.15.6
    export EPICS_HOST_ARCH=$(${EPICS_BASE}/startup/EpicsHostArch)
    export PATH=${EPICS_BASE}/bin/${EPICS_HOST_ARCH}:${PATH}



Then to check if the installation is successful, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash 
    # Then add the following lines to the file
    caget -h
    # Then you should see the following output
    No pv name specified. ('caget -h' for help.)


.. code-block:: bash

  # Run the following command to check if the installation is successful 
    caget
    # Then you should see the following output
    No pv name specified. ('caget -h' for help.) 

if so then the installation is successful.

EPICS IOC Creation
------------------

.. code-block:: bash

        # To create a new IOC
        mkdir testIOC
        cd testIOC
        makeBaseApp.pl -t -i ioc iocName
        cd configure
        vim RELEASE
        # make sure everything is correct in the file
        cd
        cd testIOC
        cd testApp
        cd db
        vim test.db

Add the following lines to the test.db file

.. include:: recored.txt

.. code-block:: bash

    cd
    cd testIOC
    vim Makefile



Only the following lines should be in the Makefile file.

.. include:: Text-material/recored.txt


.. code-block:: bash

    cd
    cd testIOC
    vim Makefile


IOC Database
............

In the IOC database, there are units of PV's called **Records**. Each of these records have a specific type that allows them to alter the functionality of the PV. In every one of these records, there are **fields**, in which include attributes and some of the possible functions that that the PV could do. 

**Record:** an object with a unique name, properties (**fields**) and contains information (data) where different data types can appear in different fields. A record also has the ability to perform actions on data.

**Naming a PV:** a PV is comprised of two parts
- The record name
- The name of a field belonging to that record

For example: ``ARIDI-PCT:CURRENT.`` in this case most record fields can be accessed individually.

Note: if no field name is given, Channel Access will default to using the .VAL field. 

A general structure of what you might see in an IOC in terms of records and fields is the following:

.. code-block:: bash

  record(ai, "test:Altitude_PV") {
    field(INP, "@user")
    field(VAL, 0.0)
  }


  record(ai, "test:Base_PV") {
    field(INP, "@user")
    field(VAL, 0.0)
  }


  record(calc, "test:Calc_PV") {
    field(DESC, "Calculation of side C (hypotenuse)")
    field(CALC, "SQR(A*A + B*B)")
    field(INPA, "test:Altitude_PV CP")
    field(INPB, "test:Base_PVÂ CP")
  }

As mentioned previously, altering these records could be done using the

The documentation for the list of records on EPICS and their respective fields can be found on this page: https://epics.anl.gov/EpicsDocumentation/AppDevManuals/RecordRef/Recordref-3.html

After curating your IOC database, in order to interact with it one would have to use a Channel Access (CA) Client. 

Some of the most used CA clients are the following: 

- Command line tools(caget,caput,...)
  .. image:: images/EPICS_slide21.png

- ALH: Alarm Handler
  .. image:: images/EPICS_slide25.png
  .. image:: images/EPICS_slide24.png

- StripTool: Strip-chart Plotting Tool
  .. image:: images/EPICS_slide27.png

- catQtDM: Display Manager

IOC Hypotenuse Project Exercise
...............................
After knowing the Database section this is a small Exercise that would help you to put your knowledge into practice. 



- Define a record that calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle. The record should have two input fields, A and B, and one output field, VAL. The record should calculate the hypotenuse using the following formula:
.. math::
    Hypo= \sqrt{A^2 + B^2}


- To test :in your terminal
    * caput <record_name>:A <value>
    * caput <record_name>:B <value>
    * caget <record_name>
